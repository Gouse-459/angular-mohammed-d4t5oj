<!-- 

        We want you to create a Angular application that has the following areas.
        You may use any CSS like bootstrap to make the pages look nice.


        Requirement 1:
        Fetch the list of persons through below api by calling the api 10 times with a delay of 1 second in each call(it will provide random results) and display the result only when all the data has been received:
        GET method
        https://hub.dummyapis.com/vj/CWmKH7p

        Requirement 2:
        Show the data in a "card" format rather than a simple list.
        (Card view is preffered but tabular data display is also acceptable).
        (CardView should be a custom component with input parameters).

        On the card show the below values:
            "ID",
            "Name",
            "Color",
            "Price",
            "Availability",
            "Country",
            "Created On".

        Requirement 3:
        To show the "Country", you should use a pipe to show "uppercase".
        Use the color value from "productColor" to set the background of card with 40 percent opacity.

        Requirement 4:
        Clicking on the name of any person should open a new page using routing and show data in that page.

        -->
        <!-- "ID",
            "Name",
            "Color",
            "Price",
            "Availability",
            "Country",
            "Created On". -->
